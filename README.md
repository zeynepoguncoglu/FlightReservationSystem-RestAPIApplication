# FlightReservationSystem-RestAPIApplication

A simple Rest API application belonging to a basic flight reservation system is developed by using Flask in Python.

The repository contains two **.py** and three **.png** files. 

- **app.py** contains the source code of the Rest API application for the flight reservation system. 
- **data.py** contains the mock data used for the flight reservation system's database.
- **FlightReservationSystem-EndpointsHighLevel.png** is the image showing the endpoints of the Rest API application as high level.
- **FlightReservationSystem-EndpointsExplanations.png** is the image showing the endpoints and their explanations of the Rest API application as detailed.
- **FlightReservationSystem-DatabaseTablesColumns.png** is the image showing the tables and columns in the database of the Rest API application.

In order to launch the Rest API application the **app.py** and **data.py** files should be downloaded and then run. By using a rest client, such as postman, queries can be send.
